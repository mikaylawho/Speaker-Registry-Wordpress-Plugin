Speaker Registry Wordpress Plugin
=================================
Original development by Mikel Hensley.

Wordpress Plugin for an organizational public speaker registry. 

To use, download the kyss-speaker-registry.zip and upload using the plugin upload feature in Wordpress. Or install the zip file
directly into wp-content/plugins and extract directly. Configuration instructions can be found in the wp-admin menu under 
"Settings/Speaker Registry." 

The Speaker List (list of user-created speaker objects) is located on the Wordpress site at 
http://yourdomain.com/kyss_speakers.  

Updates:
Version 1.0.1: Style updates to improve the display on more recent responsive Wordpress Themes. Also added the sidebar view 
to the Speaker pages, and pagination (10 per page) on the speaker list and topic search pages.
