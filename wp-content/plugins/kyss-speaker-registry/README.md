Original development by Mikel Hensley.

Wordpress Plugin for an organizational public speaker registry. 

To use, download the kyss-speaker-registry.zip and upload using the plugin upload feature in Wordpress. Or install the zip file
directly into wp-content/plugins and extract directly. Configuration instructions can be found in the wp-admin menu under 
"Settings/Speaker Registry." 

The Speaker List (list of user-created speaker objects) is located on the Wordpress site at
