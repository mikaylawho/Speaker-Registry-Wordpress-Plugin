Speaker Registry Wordpress Plugin
=================================
Original development by Mikel Hensley.

Wordpress Plugin for an organizational public speaker registry. 

To use, download the kyss-speaker-registry.zip and upload using the plugin upload feature in Wordpress. Or install the zip file
directly into wp-content/plugins and extract directly. Configuration instructions can be found in the wp-admin menu under 
"Settings/Speaker Registry." 

The Speaker List (list of user-created speaker objects) is located on the Wordpress site at 
http://yourdomain.com/kyss_speakers.  

There is a current issue with the Speaker Page URL's being broken when the plugin is first installed. Until this is resolved,
 you can fix the issue by going to the site Permalinks settings and re-saving your permalink setting. All permalink settings EXCEPT
 'Default' will work.

Updates:
Version 1.0.2: Revision of Speaker List pagination to display as '<<Prev 1234..10 Next>>' 

Version 1.0.1: Style updates to improve the display on more recent responsive Wordpress Themes. Also added the sidebar view 
to the Speaker pages, and pagination (10 per page) on the speaker list and topic search pages.
